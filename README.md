# FlickrExplorer
A simple flickr explorer app to search photos

To run this app, you need Flickr API key.
After obtaining your Flickr API key from Flickr, create a Secrets.plist file and put it in the Settings folder.

The Secrets.plist key should contain at least:

```
<key>FlickrAPISecret</key>
<string>your flickr API secret</string>
<key>FlickrAPIKey</key>
<string>your flickr API key</string>
```
